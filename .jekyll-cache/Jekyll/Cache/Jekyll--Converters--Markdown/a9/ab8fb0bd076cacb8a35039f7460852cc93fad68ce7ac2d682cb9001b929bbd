I"6<p>I built the Lounge Chair designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Nakashima">George Nakashima</a> at the “Wang Yan” woodworking workshop (忘言手作) in Shenzhen, China (April - May, 2017). I learned lots of woodworking skills from my instructors and gave the chair to my father.</p>
