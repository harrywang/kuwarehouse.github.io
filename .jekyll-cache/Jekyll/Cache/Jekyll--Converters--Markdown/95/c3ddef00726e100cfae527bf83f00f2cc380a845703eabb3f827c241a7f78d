<p>I enjoy making wood objects and woodworking sort of becomes my meditation. You can check out some of my projects on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ku_warehouse_store/">Instagram</a> and items for sale on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/KuWarehouse">Etsy</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
