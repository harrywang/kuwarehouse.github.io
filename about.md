Kù (庫) means Warehouse in Chinese, which is one of the characters on ancient Chinese bronze inscriptions from the Shang Dynasty (1600 - 1046 BC) to the Zhou Dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) [[EN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_bronze_inscriptions), [ZH](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%87%91%E6%96%87)].

I am a researcher/educator/entrepreneur in AI and Data Science and started to learn woodworking in 2017. I enjoy designing and making wood objects in the small woodworking studio in my garage. You can check out some of my projects on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ku_warehouse_store/). I also use blogs to document my projects - some of them are not related to woodworking.

Thanks for visiting!
