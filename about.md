Kù (库) means Warehouse in Chinese, which is the brand I created for my woodworking hobby.

I am a researcher and educator in AI and Data Science and started to learn woodworking in 2017. 

The following shows the small woodworking studio in my garage:

I enjoy designing and making wood objects and woodworking has sort of become my meditation. You can check out some of my projects on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ku_warehouse_store/) and items for sale on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KuWarehouse). 

Thanks for visiting!
