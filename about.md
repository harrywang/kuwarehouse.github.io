I enjoy making wood objects and woodworking sort of becomes my meditation. You can check out some of my projects in the [Blog](/blog) page and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ku_warehouse_store/). I also sell some wood objects on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KuWarehouse). 

Thanks for visiting!
