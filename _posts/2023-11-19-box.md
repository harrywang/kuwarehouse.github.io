I made this 3-in-1 (30/24/20 inches) Plyometrics Box from a 23/32 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft Plywood Panel [Home Depot Link](https://www.homedepot.com/p/23-32-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Cabinet-Grade-Plywood-Panel-Actual-0-688-in-x-48-in-x-96-in-1077486/302610611).

The plan was found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl8JoSm4mUg) and I redraw it by adding more details and some notes using Figma ([download Figma file here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1307882493081482379/3-in-1-plyo-box)):
